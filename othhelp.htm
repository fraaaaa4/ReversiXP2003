      <H2>The game</H2>
      <P>Othello is a traditional bordgame for two players, namely
      black and white.</P>
      <P> Rule One of the game says <B>black</B> always <B>starts</B> first. 
      Thus, at the start of the game, you will be asked to choose a color.</P>
      <P>The player who has, at the end of the game, the most pieces of his own
      color on the playing field, is the winner.</P>
      <P>How you conquer this pieces, is easiest to explain by means of an
      animation that shows one move :</P>
      <P ALIGN=center><IMG SRC="./othello.gif" ALT="othello.gif" BORDER=0></P>
      <P><SMALL>(Sorry, it's in Dutch)</SMALL> :</P>
      <P>You always put one of your own pieces next to one of the opponent.
      &quot; Next to &quot; is in this case : in all directions
      (horizontal + vertical + diagonaal) 
      There also has to be one piece of your own color further on,
      so you can &quot;<B>turn over</B>&quot; all the opponent pieces 
      <B>in between</B>.</P>
      
      <H2>Game control</H2>
      <P>You can play the game using the <B>mouse</B> or the <B>keyboard</B>.</P>
      <P>You <B>start</B> the game of course using the Start button
      or by hitting the Enter-key. Once started you do the same to stop
      the game.</P>
      <P>When it's your turn to play, you can <B>choose a particular position</B>
      by clicking it or by sending values between 1 and 8 (twice) with the keyboard.
      First for the chosen row, second for the column.</P>
      <P>Using the V-key or clicking the message region at the bottom
      you can review the <B>previous move</B>.</P>
